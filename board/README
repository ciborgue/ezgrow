Proposed structure is:
	<project>/<board>

Where both project and board could be 'common', so:
	common/common applies to all projects
	common/raspberrypi3 applies to all RPi3 projects
	ezgrow/common applies to all ezgrow projects
	ezgrow/raspberrypi3 applies only to ezgrow on RPi3

Scripts must go from least to most specific directories.
