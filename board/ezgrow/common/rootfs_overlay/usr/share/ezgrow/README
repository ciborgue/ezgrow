This is an actual script used in my environment. It's not going to work for you
as you likely don't have the very same hardware that I have. You'll have to
modify this to reflect YOUR hardware and YOUR requirements and place it under
the /site/etc. Make it executable too!

Basically this script has all the knowledge required for turning the equipment
on and off. Basic autoconfiguration is supported for letting the Ruby main
script know if temperature adjustment is supported for the AC (if not then just
"ON" and "OFF" will be used).
