qrInterface is a customer front-end to the library.

hint:
This is for internal debugging ONLY; please set to zero.

url:
URL parameter is a null-terminated string of a web-based handler, including
the 'http' prefix all up to '?'; for the purpose of this demo please use
'http://yegor.dyndns.tv:8888/cgi-bin/clbk?' (no quotation marks).

srcLen and src:
The buffer that holds '0210...' and '0212...' packets concatinated together
and their total length (binary data, please don't use BASE64 or ASCII).

dst:
You have to provide a buffer big enough to hold the whole matrix of desired
size (in char *); for example for v1 (21x21) you need 21x21 = 441 bytes.

Return value is a QR version that fits source data (or -1 if if doesn't fit).
Also, dst is filled with data where 1 byte represents 1 'module', or block
starting from the upper-left corner and going down.

See the QRSIZE macro for the matrix dimension (calculate for the result value).

Please also note that only one LSB matters and tells you if the module is
black or white (dst[y*QRSIZE(ver)+x] & 1); other bits are used for internal
purposes and should be masked out.
